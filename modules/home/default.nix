    # # It is sometimes useful to fine-tune packages, for example, by applying
    # # overrides. You can do that directly here, just don't forget the
    # # parentheses. Maybe you want to install Nerd Fonts with a limited number of
    # # fonts?
    # (pkgs.nerdfonts.override { fonts = [ "FantasqueSansMono" ]; })

    # # You can also create simple shell scripts directly inside your

    # (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "my-hello" ''

  # Home Manager can also manage your environment variables through
  # 'home.sessionVariables'. If you don't want to manage your shell through Home
  # Manager then you have to manually source 'hm-session-vars.sh' located at

  #
  #  ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  #
  # or
  #
  #  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
